To make this happen, I scraped transcripts from various fandom sites to collect data. I then fine tuned a Google's T5 Transformer Model and deployed this model on Hugging Face as an API. Finally, I deployed a Flask server that is our Discord Bot. Itâ€™s a fun way to interact with your favorite characters and have a conversation with them!."
